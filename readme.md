# Terminal Platform Lab (Week 1 Day 1)

## Welcome to Terminal Platform!

### Your name is Sir Pierce the Explorer. You're tasked with finding a way to get into the world of magic.

You have seen others disappear through the walls. It's somewhere within this underground platform. You will need to utilize your `terminal` skills, and the use of `cd`,  `cd ..`, and `cd -` to navigate this unknown underground. This will be a treacherous journey, so tread carefully! You never know what kind of monsters are hiding behind the corner.

I heard that once you reach a way in, you will be given a passphrase to use. Let me know what that phrase is.

I also heard that once you reach the promise land, in order to get across, you will need an extra terminal command to see it. Google search should help you with how to find the **hidden** treasure in this file structure.

Let's begin.
